    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <img src = "Picture 2.JPG">
    <p class="p">My name is Lainey. I am a junior at Piedmont High School. I was born in Seattle, Washington but I moved to California when I was in 8th grade. My favorite things to do in Seattle were going on hikes, going to sports games, playing sports in the rain, and spending time with my family and extended family that live there. Some of my favorite things to do where I live now are go to the beach and hangout with my friends and siblings. I have an older sister and a younger brother so I am in the middle. My sister is going into her sophmore year of college and my brother is going to be a freshman in high school next year. I also have a dog named Finley. My favorite food is raspberries and my favorite colors are yellow and blue.</p>
