    <p class="p">This is my puppy Finley. She is a black lab. Her last birthday fell on the same day as Thanksgiving! She is about a year and a half old so she is still very crazy. One time she evven broke my house's front window. She loves to roll around in grass and eat any type of cheese that you feed her.</p>
