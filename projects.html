    <p class="p">This is a writing piece I did first semester in my english class that I was proud of. It was a literary journalism piece. I wrote this piece about an aspect of my life and how it also related to my family generationally. It shows some of the caring traits and mannerisms that are passed down from parents to their children. To write this piece I interviewed my mom and my grandpa. I learned more about my family and why people act the way they do from this project.</p>

    <p class="p">This is a podcast that my friends and I created. Each week we make short episodes talking about current events. We wanted to make this podcast because we realized that many students at our high school were unaware of global news. This project started as an english class action project but we are going to continue making new weekly episodes next year. We research different current events, write a script, record the episode, and then release it on instagram. This project is meaningful because it helps raise awareness in our community.</p>
